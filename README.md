An R package to try and optimise a HEFCE REF submission given a list of authors and papers.

This is essentially just automating the process of shuffling people and names around that the IoP was doing manually, then doing it lots of times and picking the best scores. I make no guarantees that the scoring system is actually right according to HEFCE. And it is totally dependent on pre-defined grades for the papers (1-4*). Code has not been thoroughly tested - feel free to use it, but it comes with no guarantees of producing reasonable results.
